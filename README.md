# NetLockr-SDN-Integrated Real-Time Packet Sniffer & Network Security Enhance
The traditional network monitoring tools like Wireshark we use are powerful tools but lack programmability 
In SDN environments, administrators require real-time packet monitoring to manage control and know the parameters and performance of the network to enhance performance and also improve security
NetLockr is a network security tool that integrates ONOS (Open Network Operating System) with a real-time packet sniffer. It enables dynamic traffic monitoring and security control in SDN environments by extracting key packet information (e.g., IP headers, source/destination addresses) and sending alerts to the SDN controller. Based on these alerts, ONOS installs OpenFlow rules to block suspicious IPs and enhance network security.
